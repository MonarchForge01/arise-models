## 📊 Final Comparison: LSTM vs ARIMA for Stock Price Prediction

This project aims to evaluate and compare two time series forecasting models — **LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory)** and **ARIMA (AutoRegressive Integrated Moving Average)** — for predicting stock prices of 10 major tech companies using data from **April 2015 to March 2025**.

---

### ✅ 1. LSTM Model

**Type**: Deep learning (recurrent neural network)  
**Strength**: Learns complex, non-linear temporal dependencies  
**Results**:  
- LSTM showed **dynamic predictions** that followed real price movements well.
- RMSE and MAE values were **consistently lower** across all companies.
- Performed well even with **volatile stocks** like TSLA and META.

📌 **Key Advantage**: LSTM can learn long-term trends and sudden fluctuations in stock prices, making it suitable for financial forecasting tasks with non-linear behavior.

### ⚠️ 2. ARIMA Model

**Type**: Statistical, linear time series model  
**Strength**: Effective for stationary, linear data  
**Results**:  
- ARIMA often **flattened the predictions**, showing poor adaptability to real-world price volatility.
- Higher RMSE/MAE values.
- Limited responsiveness to non-linear market behaviors and external factors.

📌 **Key Limitation**: ARIMA assumes linear relationships and cannot adapt well to unpredictable market swings or structural changes over time.

### 📈 Visual Comparison (Example: AAPL)
- **LSTM**: Accurately tracked the rise and dips of AAPL stock over time.
- **ARIMA**: Predicted a flat line beyond a point, failing to capture fluctuations.

### 🏁 Final Verdict

| Model  | Flexibility | Handles Non-Linear Patterns | Adaptability to Volatility | Overall Accuracy |
|--------|-------------|-----------------------------|-----------------------------|------------------|
| LSTM   | High        | ✅ Yes                      | ✅ Yes                      | ⭐ High          |
| ARIMA  | Low         | ❌ No                       | ❌ No                       | 🚫 Lower        |

### 🔮 Conclusion

In real-world stock forecasting, where data is **non-stationary, noisy, and influenced by many factors**, **LSTM significantly outperforms ARIMA**. While ARIMA may still be useful for simpler, stable series, LSTM provides the **accuracy and flexibility needed** for modern financial modeling.
